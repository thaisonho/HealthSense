# HealthSense Flow Changes

## Overview of New User Flow

### Mode Page Flow
1. **User Mode**:
   - User selects "User Mode" on the mode page
   - Redirected to login page
   - After successful login, automatically redirected to measure page
   - Measurement data will be saved to the API server

2. **Guest Mode**:
   - User selects "Guest Mode" on the mode page
   - Directly redirected to measure page (no guest page in between)
   - Measurement data will NOT be saved to the API server

### Measurement Flow
1. **Measure Page**:
   - Two options: "Start Measuring" and "Return to Mode Page"
   - If "Start Measuring" is selected, redirected to measuring page

2. **Measuring Page**:
   - Shows live measurement progress
   - Auto-refreshes to display current readings and status
   - When measurement is complete, auto-redirects to measurement results page
   - ESP32 performs measurement when the web is on this page
   - Valid readings are displayed on the LCD screen in real-time

3. **Measurement Results Page**:
   - Displays final averaged results and all valid readings
   - Shows "Re-measure" button to start new measurement
   - Shows "Back to Measure Page" button to return to measure options
   - For registered users, shows "AI Analysis" button
   - For guest users, shows registration information instead of AI Analysis

## Changes Made

1. **Guest Mode Handling**:
   - Modified `handleGuest()` to directly redirect to measurement page
   - Removed interim guest page

2. **Measurement Page**:
   - Simplified to show two clear options: Start Measuring or Return to Mode
   - Made buttons larger and more prominent

3. **Measuring Process**:
   - Created dedicated measuring page (`handleContinueMeasuring()`)
   - Added live measurement stream page with auto-refresh (`handleMeasurementStream()`)
   - Set up automatic redirect to results upon completion

4. **Data Handling**:
   - Modified `sendSensorData()` to only send data to API if:
     - User is logged in (not in guest mode)
     - Measurement is complete
     - Valid user ID is available

5. **Results Page**:
   - Updated `handleMeasurementInfo()` to include:
     - Re-measure button
     - Return to measurement page button
     - Option for AI Analysis (registered users only)

## Implementation Notes

- The ESP32 measures in the same way for both user and guest modes
- Data is only sent to the server for logged-in users
- Login logic remains unchanged, just redirects differently
- All valid measurements are shown on the LCD screen regardless of mode
- The "isMeasuring" flag controls whether the device is in measurement mode

## Updated User Flow - Simple Measurement Process

1. **Simplified Measurement Pages**:
   - After pressing "Start Measurement" or "Re-measure", user sees a simple loading page
   - No live updates of measurements - those values are displayed on LCD screen only
   - After measurement completes, results page is shown automatically

2. **Clear Mode Separation**:
   - Guest mode: measurement data is only shown on device/web, not sent to server
   - User mode: measurement data is sent to server via API after completion
   - Mode is clearly displayed on all measurement pages

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - `handleContinueMeasuring()` now directly redirects to measurement_stream page
   - `handleMeasurementStream()` shows a simple spinner with mode indicator
   - `handleStartMeasurement()` starts measurement only after browser confirms page load
   - `handleMeasurementInfo()` displays final results when measurement is complete

4. **Measurement Process**:
   - User selects "Start Measuring" or "Re-measure" button
   - Browser loads the simple measurement page with spinner
   - JavaScript notifies ESP32 when page is fully loaded
   - ESP32 starts measurement and shows values on LCD only
   - When 5 valid readings are collected, browser shows results page

5. **Data Handling**:
   - Guest mode: No data sent to server, just displayed locally
   - User mode: Data sent to server after measurement completes
   - Results page shows all valid readings plus the final averaged result
