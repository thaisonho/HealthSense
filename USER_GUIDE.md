2. The device will create a WiFi network named "HealthSense"
3. Connect to this network using the password: `123123123`

### Guest Mode

Guest Mode allows you to take measurements without creating an account.

**To use Guest Mode:**

1. On the Mode Selection page, click "Guest Mode"
2. You'll be taken directly to the Measurement page

**Limitations of Guest Mode:**

## Taking Measurements

### Preparing for Measurement

For accurate readings:

1. Sit comfortably in a relaxed position
2. Ensure your hands are warm (cold fingers can affect readings)
3. Place the device on a stable surface
4. Avoid moving during the measurement

### Starting a Measurement

1. From the Measurement page, click "Start Measuring"
2. Place your fingertip gently on the sensor
   * Cover the sensor completely with your fingertip
   * Apply light pressure - not too hard, not too soft
3. Remain still while the measurement is in progress
4. The screen will display "Measuring..." and show a progress indicator

### During Measurement

1. The device's LCD screen will show:
   * Current heart rate (HR)
   * Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)
   * Finger detection status
   * Measurement progress

2. The web interface will show:
   * A progress indicator
   * Your current operation mode (User or Guest)

3. Measurements typically take 30-45 seconds to complete
   * The device needs to collect 5 valid readings
   * If readings are invalid, the process may take longer

### Viewing Results

Once the measurement is complete:

1. The browser will automatically redirect to the results page
2. The results page displays:
   * Average heart rate (BPM)
   * Average blood oxygen level (%)
   * All valid readings collected

3. From the results page, you can:
   * Click "Re-measure" to take another measurement
   * Click "Back to Measure Page" to return to the main measurement page
   * Click "AI Analysis" (User Mode only) to get an AI-generated health analysis
   * Click "Mode Select" to change operation modes

## Understanding Your Results

### Heart Rate (BPM)

- **Normal resting heart rate**: 60-100 beats per minute (BPM)
- **Athletes**: May have lower resting heart rates (40-60 BPM)
- **Elevated heart rate**: Above 100 BPM at rest could indicate stress, anxiety, or other conditions

### Blood Oxygen (SpO2)

- **Normal SpO2 levels**: 95-100%
- **Mild hypoxemia**: 90-94%
- **Moderate to severe hypoxemia**: Below 90%

> **Important**: HealthSense is not a medical device. Readings should not be used for medical diagnosis. If you consistently get abnormal readings or experience symptoms, consult a healthcare professional.

## AI Health Analysis (User Mode Only)

If you're using User Mode, you can access AI-based health analysis:

1. After taking a measurement, click "AI Analysis" on the results page
2. The system will analyze your measurements and health history
3. A summary will be displayed with general health insights

> **Note**: AI analysis is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Managing Your Device

### Reconfiguring WiFi

To connect to a different WiFi network:

1. From any page, click "Reconfigure WiFi" at the bottom
2. Follow the WiFi setup steps as outlined earlier

### Returning to Mode Selection

To change operation mode:

1. Click "Back to Mode Select" on any page
2. Select your desired mode (User or Guest)

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Connecting to WiFi

1. Verify your WiFi credentials are correct
2. Ensure your router is working properly
3. Check that your WiFi network uses 2.4 GHz (not 5 GHz)
4. Try positioning the device closer to your router

### Inaccurate Readings

1. Make sure your finger is correctly positioned on the sensor
2. Avoid moving during measurements
3. Ensure your hands are not cold
4. Try cleaning the sensor with a soft, dry cloth
5. Avoid bright direct light on the sensor

### Web Interface Not Loading

1. Verify you're connected to the correct WiFi network
2. Try accessing http://192.168.4.1 directly
3. Clear your browser cache or try a different browser
4. Restart the HealthSense device

### Measurement Process Takes Too Long

1. Ensure your finger is properly placed on the sensor
2. Keep your hand still during measurement
3. If the device can't get valid readings, it may time out after 2 minutes
4. Try again with better finger placement

## Care and Maintenance

To ensure your HealthSense device continues to work properly:

1. Store in a clean, dry place at room temperature
2. Clean the sensor gently with a soft, dry cloth
